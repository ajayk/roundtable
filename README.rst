A microservice platform by SQuaRE
=================================

At SQuaRE, we love building microservices that solve problems for the `LSST Project`_.
Roundtable is a new initiative to bring many of these services under one roof to leverage common resources, like a Kubernetes cluster, HTTP ingress for APIs, Kafka for event-based apps, monitoring and logging, and continuous deployment patterns.
At the same time, applications in the Roundtable are decentralized, and have a large amount of latitude adapt and deploy independently.
